# Youtube URl to Mp3 file Project



## Introduction 
This is my first python project as a beginner. This script uses pytube to convert YouTube URL links of videos and playlists to mp3 file with a simple GUI built with Tkinter. These mp3 files can be downloaded into a specified path/directory; however the default path is "USERPROFILE"\Onedrive\Desktop.
